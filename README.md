In this project, users can select a rating from 1 to 5 and submit their feedback. Upon submission, the component employs a smooth slider effect to transition the content, displaying a confirmation box with the selected rating. This interaction aims to provide a user-friendly experience, keeping the interface clean and responsive.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Rating Selection:** Users can easily choose a rating by clicking on one of the five options.
- **Dynamic Content Transition:** After submitting the rating, the card content slides out, and a new message with the selected rating slides in, creating a sleek and engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The component is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the basic structure of the component.
- **CSS:** To style the component and implement the sliding animations.
- **JavaScript:** To handle the user interactions, such as rating selection and content transitions.

## Project Experience

This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deeper into creating interactive web components without relying on external libraries.
